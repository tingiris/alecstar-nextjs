summary: 'The story of our memorable reunion show with the New York Flyers at Turning Stone Casino, featuring a historic all-star jam finale.'

This was the reunion that almost didn't happen. The planning started in early November, with a vision to recreate the success of the 805/Alecstar show. While several great local bands were considered, our manager had his heart set on reuniting with our old rivals from the eighties - the New York Flyers.

The path to making this show happen wasn't easy. It took nearly four months of persistent effort from our manager Mitch, reaching out to each member of the Flyers. Earl ultimately helped bring the band together, but then we faced scheduling challenges. Two potential dates fell through - first May 22nd due to miscommunication, then July 30th due to equipment logistics.

When the September 18th date was offered, it was understood this was our last chance - if this date didn't work, the show would be cancelled. Fortunately, everything finally aligned.

The most exciting addition to the show was the planned all-star jam finale, bringing members of both bands together on stage. After separate rehearsals, we had just one combined run-through during sound check. The Flyers opened the show with an incredible high-energy performance that showed no signs of their 17-year hiatus.

Our set featured special guest Gary Briggs, 805's drummer, and even saw George return to the drums for the first time since 1979! The night culminated in that historic jam session - a moment that neither the audience nor the musicians will ever forget.

We owe special thanks to our manager Mitch for making this reunion possible. His persistence brought the Flyers back together after 17 years, leading to their own CD/DVD release and website. Both bands are grateful for his dedication to keeping the music alive.
